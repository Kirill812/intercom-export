# Improvement Plan for the Intercom Export Project

This improvement plan outlines the key issues identified during recent test runs and the corresponding changes implemented to enhance the Intercom API client functionality.

---

## 1. Configuration Handling

### Issue
- The client was failing when the provided configuration had a nested `intercom` attribute.  
- The original implementation used an unchecked approach with `hasattr(config, 'intercom')`, which led to an AttributeError during test execution when an expected property was missing.

### Improvement
- Updated the constructor to safely check if a nested configuration is available using `getattr(config, 'intercom', None)`.
- This ensures that if a nested configuration is provided, it is used; otherwise, the original configuration is retained.

## 2. Payload Structure in `get_conversations`

### Issue
- The unit test expected the payload sent to the API to include a `"display_as": "plaintext"` property.
- The absence of this property resulted in a KeyError during testing.

### Improvement
- Modified the `get_conversations` method to include `"display_as": "plaintext"` in the request payload.
- This aligns the clientâ€™s payload with the test expectations and likely with the API requirements.

## 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic

### Current Implementation
- The client already includes a robust error handling mechanism in the `_handle_response` method.
- The code configures retry parameters (maximum retries, initial backoff, backoff factor, and maximum backoff) using values from the configuration, with sensible defaults.

### Next Steps
- Monitor further test outcomes to validate that all API error cases (e.g., authentication failures, rate-limit errors) are handled appropriately.
- Consider additional logging enhancements or parameterizing further aspects if API changes require adjustments.

---

## 4. Next Steps for Overall Project Quality

- **Refactoring Tests**: Continue refining unit tests to cover edge cases and additional API behaviors.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure user documentation and inline code comments reflect these design decisions.
- **Performance Review**: Benchmark the client under load or with significant numbers of conversation IDs to validate the retry/backoff configuration.

This plan has been implemented with the necessary changes to the Intercom API client. Running the test suite now should yield a successful outcome without the previously encountered errors.
